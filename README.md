# HC05-TO-PIC-AND-PC-UART-communication
The Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) module is one of the two serial I/O modules. The USART is also known as a Serial Communications Interface or SCI. The USART can be configured as a full duplex asynchronous system that can communicate with peripheral devices such as CRT terminals and personal computers, or it can be configured as a half-duplex synchronous system that can communicate with peripheral devices such as A/D or D/A integrated circuits, Serial EEPROMs etc. 

The USART can be configured in the following modes: 

• Asynchronous (full duplex)

• Synchronous - Master (half duplex)

• Synchronous - Slave (half duplex)
